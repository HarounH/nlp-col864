[paper2 - nell]

	macroreading - has redundant information.
		read a lot of texts.

	microreading - doesn't have redundant information.
		if i have learnt how to read, i should be good to go.
		extract information from a single sentence or tiny amount of data.
		figures out if stuff is mentioned in the task.

		for humans, does macroreading => microreading

	Project idea: Exploring semantic drift and how human interaction affects this.

[paper 2 contd]

	Active Learning - Provost tells us it is bad
		- learn the wrong distribution after a lot of intervention

	David Sonian Semantics
		n-ary events can be broken down into pairwise tuples...
		"person X bombing location Y using bomb-type Z on time W" can be broken down into event E such that
		E = { bomber(e, X), bombUsed(e, Z), bombLocation(e,Y), bombWhen(e,W) }

[paper 3 - openIE series]
	IE becomes domain specific.
	Ed Howie - ontologists are of 5 types. They can't reconcile differences

	Checkout : Linked Open Data (linkeddata.org); ISWC - Internet Semantic Web Conference.
		Data is open source. data uses creator's ontology. users' ontology could differ.
		Then, talking to each other is hard. Hence, a universal schema is desirable.
		However, universal schemas are hard to learn.
		Instead, we can learn to translate from one ontology to another.

	appositive thingies - linguistics

	find weaknesses in openIE demo - what website?
	Chris Re - IE dude. owns a startup that works on IE.

	Common Sense knowledge - what do we do to it?

[paper4] - you presented. it was meh. over 3 classes :D

[paper5] - mathematically, probably semi-crf are more powerful than crf. however if you change the labels a bit.. use BIO instead of IO, crfs should be the same as semi-crf, no?
